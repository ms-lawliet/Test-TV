# Create a Python Code for creating the Class named TV and a Test Driver program named TestTV
# that will create two objects from Class TV and will produce the following output:
# tv1's channel is 30 and volume level is 3
# tv2's channel is 3 and volume level is 2

from ClassTV import TV    # import class TV from ClassTV.py file

tv1 = TV("tv1", 30, 2, "off")  # create objects
tv2 = TV("tv2", 3, 2, "on")

# call methods
